Step 1: UI Development
Create HTML Files:

login.html, contactus.html, and signup.html for respective pages.
Use semantic HTML tags and structure the pages appropriately.
CSS Styling:

Create separate CSS files (login.css, contactus.css, signup.css) for styling.
Apply responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices.
Focus on user experience and intuitive design.
Step 2: Backend Setup
Initialize Node.js Project:

Use npm init to set up your project.
Install required dependencies like express, mongoose, etc., via npm.
Express Server Setup:

Create a server.js file to set up the Express server.
Configure middleware, such as body-parser, for handling form data.
Listen on a specific port (e.g., 3000) for incoming requests.
Step 3: Server and Routing
Express Routing:

Define routes for /login, /contactus, /signup, etc., in server.js.
Use app.get() and app.post() to handle different HTTP methods.
Route Handling:

Render respective HTML pages or perform actions (e.g., form submissions) in response to these routes.
Step 4: Database Integration
Mongoose Setup:

Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose in server.js.
Configure connection parameters (like database URL).
Schema and Model Creation:

Define schemas for user data (for signup) using Mongoose Schema.
Create models and methods for CRUD operations.
Backend Logic:

Implement logic in the routes (e.g., /signup) to interact with the database.
Upon signup, insert user details into the database using Mongoose models.
Step 5: UI-Backend Integration
Form Submission:

Use JavaScript to handle form submissions on the HTML pages.
Upon submission, send data to the appropriate backend route (e.g., /signup) using AJAX or form submission.
Backend Data Processing:

In backend routes, retrieve form data and process it.
Utilize Mongoose models to interact with the database and store user input (e.g., signup details).
By following these steps, you'll build a structured application where the frontend interfaces seamlessly with the backend, enabling data flow and interactions with the MongoDB database. It's a systematic approach that ensures both UI functionality and backend logic are effectively integrated.
